# Full experimental results
In this repository, we show the complete results while some of them cannot be accommodated into the main paper due to page limit.
## Backdooe removing and Correcting safety property violation.

We conduct a set of experiments on two repair tasks: 1) removing backdoor and 2) correcting safety property violation. In removing backdoor, we compare our method with CARE, RM and AI-Lancet. Three baselines are used in correcting safety property violation, i.e. CARE, PRDNN and REASSURE. 
Due to REASSURE's special mechanism, we cannot directly add it to our experiments (the time cost of repairing 10,000 samples is unacceptable). Therefore, we designed a set of new experiments for it. Specifically, we apply the limited sample experiment scenarios (i.e., 500 positive samples and different numbers of negative samples) to REASSURE and VeRe respectively for comparison. The experimental results are shown in the table below:

## The coupling between the two steps.
To investigate how effective our repair method is compared to these methods and how coupled the repair process is with the specific localisation and vice versa, we replaced our repair step with other repair methods. Specifically, we chose particle swarm optimization method from CARE, RMâ€™s fine-tune and optimization with regularization (NeVer 2.0) [2] as three baselines. We denoted the replaced baselines as PSO*, RM*, and Reg* respectively. We ran additional experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, with two number of samples available.

## Other activation functions.
To study whether our method generalizes to networks with other activations, we add a set of experiments on backdoor defense, in which the ReLU activation function in each neural network model is replaced with the
Sigmoid activation function.
