To reproduce our experiments, this folder should contain the GTSRB dataset and the model under backdoor attack. 

Our models are uploaded in:

* Model attacked by BadNets:  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2lSCCZs0xCKjtZOGVi_a1KsqhHHE-RQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download</a> 
* Model attacked by Blend:  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XHrbXKnFipNRc8kmFHQM460bgktE02Y/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download</a>
